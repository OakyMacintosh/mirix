# The MIRIX Operating System
# (c) 2025-6 OakyMacintosh :3
#
# This is a generic target configuration for awk/gawk/mawk, this target is
# made to not use any common UNIX targets listed and hard coded to mirix.
# This will allow any non-UNIX or non-POSIX systems that have a awk port to run
# the MIRIX kernel as a generic ELF binary or a native binary using an specific
# C/C++ compiler paired with a portable implementation of bsdmake in awk.
#
# This is free and OpenSource Software, so if you paid for this code you got scammed.
